# Description
This course provides a brief introduction to the fundamentals of the R language and focuses on its use for data analysis--including exploratory data analysis, linear and logistic regression, variable selection, model diagnostics, and prediction.

Please download and install R and RStudio before coming to class (see the [Pre-Workshop Instructions](#Instructions) for more details).

### Step 1: Download and install R
First, visit The R Project for Statistical Computing's website through <https://www.r-project.org/>. Click on "CRAN" under the Download section on the left-hand side of the page. Then, click on any of the nearby websites under the USA section near the bottom of the page. For example, the link from the University of California, Berkley, CA or University of California, Los Angeles, CA are both fine. Download R for your platform (Linux, Mac, or Windows).

### Step 2: Download and install RStudio
RStudio is a set of integrated tools designed to help you be more productive with R; it is known to be more user-friendly. You will be doing essentially all of your programming in RStudio. To download RStudio, go to <https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/>. Download the installer for your platform under "Installers for Supported Platforms".
